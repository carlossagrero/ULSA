# Release 2.12.1

This is a patched release to address a few important bugs. Please see the [Release 2.12.0 release notes](v2_12_0.md) for details on the first cut.

Specifically, patches on top of v2.10.0 in this release do the following:
* [Error if Tern calls Scancode-Toolkit](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1202): The Scancode library updated several of the attribute names in its output which was causing errors when Tern would run with Scancode. This fix now accomodates the new attribute property names in the newer versions of Scancode, as well as the older value names (in case we have users still using older Scancode versions).
* [Can't build images with Dockerfile samples](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1235): Several of the `samples` Dockerfiles were using stale base images, causing the image build to fail. This fix updates the base images.
